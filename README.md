# Calculator-
I originally wrote this code under my course ECS102 in which I learnt about C programming. Furthur i implemented SOLID principles and made the code modular and imporved readibility.
I furthur added ability to add,subtract and perform other basic operation which are expected from a basic calculator turning it into a calculator with some extra fuctionality such as ability to print fibonacci numbers
The following are its abilities:- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder, exponents, GCD, LCM, factorials, printing fibonacci numbers upto the given limit.
